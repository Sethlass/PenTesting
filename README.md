## Network Discovery and Vulnerability Scanner
This project is a sophisticated network discovery and vulnerability scanner designed to perform extensive reconnaissance on local networks. It utilizes advanced techniques to identify live hosts, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities, making it an invaluable tool for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals.

Features
* ARP Scanning: Efficiently detects live hosts on the network using Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
* ICMP Ping Sweep: Identifies active devices via ICMP echo requests, ensuring that no device goes undetected.
* TCP SYN Scanning: Checks for open TCP ports using SYN packets, a stealthy technique to identify services without completing the handshake.
* Vulnerability Assessment: Employs Nmap scripts to discover vulnerabilities such as the infamous EternalBlue exploit on SMB services.
* MAC Address Manufacturer Lookup: Maps MAC addresses to manufacturers using the macvendors.co API for device identification.
* IPv6 NDP Scanning: Extends network discovery to IPv6 networks by performing Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) scans.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites:

* Python 3.6 or higher https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Ensure you have Nmap installed on your system. https://nmap.org/download

## Installation:

Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Sethlass/PenTesting
    cd network-scanner

Set Up the Virtual Environment:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Main Script:
    
    python main.py
    
Script Output:

* The script will display information about detected devices, open ports, potential 
  vulnerabilities, and device manufacturers.
* The results will include a summary of all scans performed, including ARP scans, ICMP ping 
  sweeps, TCP SYN scans, and Nmap vulnerability assessments.

Requirements:
* scapy: For network packet crafting and analysis.
* python-nmap: For advanced network scanning and vulnerability detection.
* requests: For API queries to resolve MAC addresses to manufacturers.
